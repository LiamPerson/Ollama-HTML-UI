# Ollama HTML UI

A minimal interface in pure HTML/CSS for talking with Ollama.

All code exists in a minimal amount of files so it is completely auditable.

Run this program by opening `index.html`. That's it! No special compilation or any of that garbage ðŸª½

# Purpose

I am sick of seeing a bunch of random interfaces that depend on a whole bunch of nonsense. I know I want something simple that works that I can trust. You're here, so you probably do too.

- No third-parties
- No dependencies (NPM/PIP/etc...)
- No online scripts (cdnjs etc...)
